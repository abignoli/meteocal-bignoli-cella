MeteoCal is a web application that helps users in organizing events, managing scheduling and monitoring weather forecasts. 

Registered users are able to create events and invite any number of other users in the platform to participate. 

Events can be of any kind, specified by title and description provided by the organizer. For each event it is possible to specify a geographic location, whether it will take place indoors or outdoors. Moreover the organizer and the participants can monitor weather forecasts for the event, receiving notifications by the system in case of adverse weather conditions. The system also supports the organizer in re-scheduling the event, by suggesting a better date. In case of any change regarding the event, all participants are notified automatically.

Any event can be public or private. Public events are open to all users, while private ones are visible only to invited ones.

Moreover users can visualize their own calendar and manage their appointments in an integrated view. They can also choose to make their calendar visible to their connections, or keep it private.

The application is implemented in Java EE, and has been tested on a GlassFish server and a MySQL database to store application data. Both source code and WAR format (Web application ARchive) are released.

The installation manual can support interested users in deploying the released software on a server of choice.
